# Nebulide.exe
This is a GDI malware I created in about 2 weeks. It will show effects and play sounds. Watch my video demonstrating this trojan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSx9CHh1xKA&t=131s

Do not steal any of my code without crediting me!

Please let me know about any bugs or issues. This is intended to be used on Windows XP x64.

# ⚠️Warning
This is a harmful malware that will overwrite the master boot record! It is for educational and entertainment purposes only. Never run this on your real PC or anyone else's. There is no safe version of this, so be very careful. Before running you will see two warnings. I'm not responsible for damage at all. Also, always be cautious of flashing lights and loud sounds when testing my malwares or watching my videos. You have been warned!
